;;; It would be a logical extension to throw in a "slot" for x^2 so
;;; that you could also extract the variance and standard deviation

;; An IRC discussion on the performance of this: <cstim> rlb: I was
;; wondering which one would perform better: The directly stored
;; lambda in make-{stats,commodity}-collector, or just a value
;; somewhere with an exhaustive set of functions on it?  <rlb> cstim:
;; my guess in the long run, a goops object would be most appropriate,
;; and barring that, a record with a suitable set of functions defined
;; to manipulate it would be faster, but in the short run (i.e. until
;; we switch to requiring goops), it might not be worth changing.
;; However, a record for the data (or vector) and a set of 7 functions
;; would still be faster, if for no other reason than because you
;; don't have to do the "case" lookup.  That penalty can be avoided if
;; you follow the other strategy where passing in 'adder simply
;; returns the function, rather than calling it.  Then the user's code
;; can cache the value when repeated lookups would be expensive.  Also
;; everyone should note that in some tests Bill and I did here, plain
;; old alists were faster than hash tables until you got to a
;; reasonable size (i.e. greater than 10 elements, maybe greater than
;; 30...)  <cstim> rlb: hm, that makes sense. However, any change
;; would break existing code, so if I would go for speed optimization
;; I might just go for the record-and-function-set way.  <rlb> cstim:
;; yes.  I think that would still be faster.

;;

;;
;; New Example: But now USD is a <gnc:commodity*> and 123.4 a
;; <gnc:numeric>, so there is no simple example anymore.
;;
;; The functions:
;;   'add <commodity> <amount>: Add the given amount to the 
;;       appropriate currencies' total balance.
;;   'format <fn> #f: Call the function <fn> (where fn takes two
;;       arguments) for each commodity with the arguments <commodity>
;;       and the corresponding total <amount>. The results is a list
;;       of each call's result.
;;   'merge <commodity-collector> #f: Merge the given other
;;       commodity-collector into this one, adding all currencies'
;;       balances, respectively.
;;   'minusmerge <commodity-collector> #f: Merge the given other 
;;       commodity-collector into this one (like above) but subtract
;;       the other's currencies' balance from this one's balance,
;;       respectively.
;;   'reset #f #f: Delete everything that has been accumulated

;;   'getpair <commodity> signreverse?: Returns the two-element-list
;;       with the <commodity> and its corresponding balance. If
